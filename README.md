We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-workspace/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
    module "workspace" {
    source       = "clouddrove/workspace/aws"
    version     = "0.15.0"
    name         = "workspace"
    environment  = "test"
    enabled      =  true

    workspace_username = "Administrator"
    label_order        = ["name", "environment"]
    bundle_id          = "wsb-8pmj7b7pq"
    directory_id       = module.ad.directory_id
    }

```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| bundle\_id | The ID of the bundle for the WorkSpace. | `string` | `"wsb-bh8rsxt14"` | no |
| compute\_type\_name | The compute type. For more information, see Amazon WorkSpaces Bundles. Valid values are VALUE, STANDARD, PERFORMANCE, POWER, GRAPHICS, POWERPRO and GRAPHICSPRO. | `string` | `"VALUE"` | no |
| directory\_id | The ID of the directory for the WorkSpace. | `string` | `""` | no |
| enabled | Flag to control the WorkSpaces creation. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove' or 'AnmolNagpal'. | `string` | `"anmol@clouddrove.com"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| repository | Terraform current module repo | `string` | `"https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-workspace"` | no |
| root\_volume\_encryption\_enabled | Indicates whether the data stored on the root volume is encrypted. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| root\_volume\_size\_gib | The size of the root volume. | `number` | `80` | no |
| running\_mode | The running mode. For more information, see Manage the WorkSpace Running Mode. Valid values are AUTO\_STOP and ALWAYS\_ON. | `string` | `"AUTO_STOP"` | no |
| running\_mode\_auto\_stop\_timeout\_in\_minutes | The time after a user logs off when WorkSpaces are automatically stopped. Configured in 60-minute intervals. | `number` | `60` | no |
| user\_volume\_encryption\_enabled | Indicates whether the data stored on the user volume is encrypted. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| user\_volume\_size\_gib | The size of the root volume. | `number` | `10` | no |
| volume\_encryption\_key | The symmetric AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) used to encrypt data stored on your WorkSpace. Amazon WorkSpaces does not support asymmetric CMKs. | `string` | `null` | no |
| workspace\_username | The user name of the user for the WorkSpace. This user name must exist in the directory for the WorkSpace. | `string` | `"Administrator"` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| computer\_name | n/a |
| id | outputs of aws workspaces |
| ip\_address | n/a |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
